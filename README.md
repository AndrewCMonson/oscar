## Introduction

This project is an OpenAI-based personal assistant aimed at helping solo developers and junior developers manage their projects. It can help with project management tasks, architectural design and integrate with other tools via natural language.

The main goal of this project is for junior level developers, or anyone interested in AI, to have an opportunity to contribute to a project.
